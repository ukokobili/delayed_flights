### Data Sources

The datasets employed in this analysis are sourced from:

- **Kaggle**: Detailed flight data for the US in 2023.
- **IATA**: Airport codes and related geolocation information.
- **Meteostat**: Weather data that may influence flight delays.

**Additional Data Sources** include:
- Historical records of flight delays.
- Detailed operational statistics for airports.

### Methodology

#### Tools Used
- [Kaggle API](#): For data extraction.
- [dbtâ„¢](#): For robust data transformation and modeling.
- [MotherDuck](#): Used as a scalable data warehouse.
- [Preset.io](#): For insightful dashboard visualizations.
- [GitHub](#): For version control and collaboration.
- [GitHub Actions](#): For continuous integration and deployment, automating the workflow from data model updates to deployment in Snowflake.

#### Applied Techniques
- **Data Cleaning**: Employed dbt for refining data and ensuring precision.
- **Data Modeling**: Utilized dbt to architect a star schema for efficient data queries.
- **Data Warehousing**: Leveraged Snowflake's capabilities for managing extensive datasets.
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment**: Utilized GitHub Actions to create a seamless pipeline for automatic updates and consistency checks.

### Dashboards

Our dashboards offer a deep-dive into:
- **Temporal Delays**: Insight into how delays fluctuate over months.
- **Airline Performance**: Analyses on specific airline delay and cancellation rates.
- **Weather Impact**: Exploration of the correlation between weather conditions and flight punctuality.
